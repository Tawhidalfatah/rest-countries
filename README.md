This was my Typescript React practice project with vite. I was familliar with ts but didnt apply it until this project. So i had to learn the basics of ts from youtube resources and chatgpt and then applied it into the project with basic param validations and type validations and also functional component validation with ts. This is almost my first demo project with pagination implemented in the frontend. I took a lot of help from chatGPT for pagination as this is my work with pagination. React tabs was used for pagination and logic was written with the help of ChatGPT. 
Below are the minor and major functionalities in this demo project---




- Sort Countries by Ascending or Descending order (Ascending by default)
- Sort Countries that are smaller than Lithuania by area.
- Sort Countries that are in “Oceania” region.
- Pagination at the bottom with corresponding page numbers showing 10 countries each
- Loading spinner shows when the component is in data fetching state for better ux.
